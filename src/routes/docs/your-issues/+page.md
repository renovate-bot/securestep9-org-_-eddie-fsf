title: Your issues
---

The project is able to not just crawl the `EddieHubCommunity` on Github for `good-first-issues`, but also for a second label in GitHub globally:

`EddieHub:good-first-issue`

By applying this label to your issues it gets picked up by this application. Before adding and using the label we kindly ask to make a couple of things sure:

1. Make sure the issue has a proper description, so its clear for people what the expectations are and how the issue can be resolved.
1. this label is not intended to be used to ask other people for advice or help
